# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of **regexcite** is to make regular expressions in R more accessible and enjoyable. It provides lightweight helper functions that wrap around `stringr` to simplify common string operations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **regexcite** from [GitHub](https://github.com/jennybc/regexcite) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/regexcite")
```

## Example

A common task when working with strings is splitting a single string into multiple parts. Base R returns a list, but regexcite gives you the character vector directly.
```{r}
library(regexcite)
## basic example code
x <- "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta"
str_split_one(x, pattern = ",")
```

You can also leverage `stringr` features, like controlling the number of splits or using fixed patterns:
```{r}
str_split_one(x, pattern = ",", n = 2)

y <- "192.168.0.1"
str_split_one(y, pattern = stringr::fixed("."))
```

## Motivation
The `str_split_one()` function simplifies `stringr::str_split()` when you know you're working with a single string. It also includes error handling for longer inputs, making it safer and easier to debug.
